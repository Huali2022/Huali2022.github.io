I am dedicated to developing novel statistical methods tailored for handling complex structured data and addressing associated challenges. My specific areas of interest encompass measurement errors, transfer learning, high-dimensional inference, and compositional data analysis. 
  
If you are interested in my research, please feel free to email me and we can discuss further. Looking forward to working on an interesting research project together.
