My present research focuses on addressing error-in-variable issues with complex structured data and related problems. Specifically, I'm interested in the following topics:

- measurement error analysis,
- model misspecification,
- high-dimensional data analysis,
- compositional data analysis.
  
If you are interested in my research, please feel free to email me and we can discuss further.
